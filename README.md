# BeeCrowd_In_C_With_CUnit

This repository contains the programming challenges proposed by the judge.beecrowd website (website) solved in C language (C99 standard)

To facilitate validation and debugging of the challenges, this repository uses CUnit, which is the unit testing library for the C programming language.

In the future I will use other unit testing libraries for the C language such as:

* Unity
* Check
* CMocka
* MinUnit
* Criterion
* gtest (Google Test)
